            <h>India</h>
            <p>Located in Southern Asia, India is a country with a population that comprises of more than a billion people. It is home to briliant minds.India achieved its independence from the British rule in 1947.<br> It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country since 2023 and, since its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia.
                <br>
                India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to over 1.4 billion in 2023.During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.Indian movies and music increasingly influence global culture. India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,and rising levels of air pollution. India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,is supported in protected habitats.
               <br>
                Some great facts about India:
                <ul>
                   <li> India never invaded any country in her last 100000 years of history.</li>
                   <li>When many cultures were only nomadic forest dwellers over 5000 years ago, Indians established Harappan culture in Sindhu Valley (Indus Valley Civilization)</li>
                   <li>Algebra, Trigonometry and Calculus are studies, which originated in India.
                   <li>The 'Place Value System' and the 'Decimal System' were developed in India in 100 B.C.</li>
                   <li>The world's first granite temple is the Brihadeswara Temple at Tanjavur, Tamil Nadu. The shikhara of the temple is made from a single 80-tonne piece of granite.                        This magnificent temple was built in just five years, (between 1004 AD and 1009 AD) during the reign of Rajaraja Chola.</li>
                   <li>The game of Snakes & Ladders was created by the 13th century poet saint Gyandev. It was originally called 'Mokshapat'. The ladders in the game represented virtues and the snakes indicated vices. The game was played with cowrie shells and dices. In time, the game underwent several modifications, but its meaning remained the same, i.e. good deeds take people to heaven and evil to a cycle of re-births.</li>
